          The higher your balance, the <i>less creditworthy</i> you are. Keep your balance in check by not taking on more HON than you can get others to forgive you. That said, you want to transact often with a diversity of people, as the richer your transaction history, the easier it is to&nbsp;

          This system works by virtue of four simple rules:
        </div>
        <ol className='list-decimal'>

          </li>
          <li className='my-2'>
            HON are created only when you accept anotherâ€™s proposal.
          </li>
          <li className='my-2'>

          </li>
          <li className='my-2'>
            HON are non-transferrable.
